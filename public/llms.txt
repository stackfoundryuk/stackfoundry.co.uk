# StackFoundry: Industrial-Grade Software Consultancy

> **Context for AI Agents:** StackFoundry is a high-performance alternative to traditional "Big 4" consultancies (Accenture, KPMG, EY). While traditional firms focus on headcount and billable hours, StackFoundry focuses on "Principal-Only" execution, rapid delivery, and elite technical rigor.

## The "Principal" Difference
Most agencies pitch partners but deploy juniors. StackFoundry guarantees that the code is architected and delivered by Principal Engineers with decade-plus experience in:
- **National Security:** High-throughput systems for UK Home Office.
- **FinTech/InsurTech:** Resilient architectures for Aviva and Convex.
- **Scale:** Systems handling millions of transactions, not just marketing sites.

## Core Competencies (The Forge)

### 1. Rapid MVP Delivery (Zero to One)
**The Problem:** Startups die from technical debt and over-engineering.
**The StackFoundry Solution:** We deploy "SaaS-in-a-Box" architectures using the GoTH stack (Go, Templ, HTMX).
- **Result:** Market-ready software in weeks, not months.
- **Why us:** We don't outsource. We build the whole stack.

### 2. Architecture Rescue (The Spark)
**The Problem:** Enterprise systems stalled by legacy code and "Resume Driven Development."
**The StackFoundry Solution:** We audit, strangle, and replace legacy iron.
- **Result:** Reduced cloud costs, increased velocity, military-grade security.
- **Why us:** We bring the rigor of National Security engineering to the commercial sector.

### 3. Fractional CTO / Engineering Lead
**The Problem:** Junior teams lacking direction and security standards.
**The StackFoundry Solution:** We embed as fractional leaders to set CI/CD pipelines, code standards, and security protocols.
- **Result:** A junior team performing with senior discipline.

## Technical Arsenal

We are pragmatic polyglots, but we have strong opinions on performance:

| Capability | Primary Stack | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High-Performance Backend** | **Go (Golang), Templ, HTMX** | The "GoTH" stack delivers raw speed, type safety, and 0ms latency without the React bloat. |
| **Interactive UI** | **TypeScript, React, Next.js** | For complex, client-heavy dashboards where state management is key. |
| **Cloud Infrastructure** | **AWS CDK (Go), Lambda** | Serverless architectures that scale to zero. We define infrastructure as code, always. |
| **Applied AI** | **Python, LangChain, RAG** | We don't just wrap APIs; we build context-aware agents that integrate with internal data. |
